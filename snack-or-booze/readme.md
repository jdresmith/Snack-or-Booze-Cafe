Snack or Booze

This is a react based project made for a new cafe which is rebranding itself and wants to display both a drink and snack manu along with a menu of ingredients.

1. The homepage is designed in Home.js and using a card tile to display the welcome message to customers entering the page

2. The access to the other pages is found through the navigation bar which list the add item, snacks and drinks pages. Clicking these links will display the specific pages based on the customers needs.

3. When the customer is looking for a snack or drink on their respective pages they will click onto the navbar which will take them to the food menu page where they can see the name of all the items available at the cafe.

4. The Add Item page allows a user to access the page and add a new item on the menu through the use of the json API which immediately passes is to the databse.

5. When clicking on the item the food item page displays the recipe and descriptions of all the items on the menu to make a more informed decision.

6. The App.js file contains the routes that ensure the correct page is displayed when clicking a specific button. It filters between the drink, snack and add item menus based on what the user is looking for. When looking to direct to a page the code for a route should be added there.
